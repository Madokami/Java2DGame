Direction doesn't matter for the following:
effect_hanabi
effect_ring
effect_tame
madoka_magic_fire
bom_kemuri

so you only need to make 1 row of Images for the above as opposed to the usual 4 rows.

The rest are all projectiles, make it so the directions are:

down
left
right
up

For all projectiles the default direction you're seeing from the image is the "right" direction in case you're confused for some of them.

*Keep the original image size and remove all background.
